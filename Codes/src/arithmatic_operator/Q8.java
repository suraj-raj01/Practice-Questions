8. If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly
   payment using the following formula:

   > interest = balance x (annualInterestRate/1200)

   Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and displays the interest for the next
   month.
